# Spatial Glossary - A Hooten lab reference

## kernel vs. kernel convolution
- Some stuff about kernels
  - my favorite are **popcorn** kernels

## Spectral representation vs. Eigen decomposition
1. We should also have a discussion about Ectoplasmic decomposition, whatever that is
  1. *Slimer* is my favorite *ghost* 
2. Let's rank things with an ordered list 

## Gaussian Process vs. everything else
+ Let's add in a snippet of R code
```R
rnorm(mu, sigma)
```

## Covariance matrix vs. Covariance Function


## Kriging

## Splines

## Wavelets

## REML

## IRWLS

## Non-identifiability of sill/nugget

## stationarity and isotropy
